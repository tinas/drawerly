# Drawerly

Drawerly is a modular and framework-agnostic system for building stacked drawer interfaces.
It provides a minimal core engine for state and lifecycle management, along with optional framework adapters for seamless integration.

Drawerly focuses on predictable behavior, clean APIs, and full control over presentation, allowing teams to implement custom drawer experiences without being restricted by UI opinions.
